You are localizing the object referred to by the phrase in the given image.
Output the bounding box as coordinates in the range [0,1000], strictly ordered as (x1, y1, x2, y2) where x1 ≤ x2 and y1 ≤ y2.
If needed, swap/clip the numbers so they remain within [0,1000] and satisfy the order.
You MUST follow this output format exactly:
First, think step-by-step about visual cues (category, attributes, spatial relations) inside <think> and </think>.
Then, on a new line immediately after the first </think>, output ONLY:
Answer: {"bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2]}
Here is an example:
<think>
The phrase mentions a small red car near the bottom-right road. I scan the lower-right quadrant, find a compact red vehicle; its left/top and right/bottom edges align roughly with these positions.
</think>
Answer: {"bbox": [742, 612, 865, 706]}
